    "summary": "It remains challenging to systematically survey nearby diffuse dwarf galaxies\nand address the formation mechanism of this population distinguishing from\nregular ones. We carry out a pilot search for these galaxies in the COSMOS\nfield using the deep \\textit{HST}/F814W imaging data. We report three diffuse\ndwarf galaxies satisfying the criteria: (1) redshift $z<0.2$, (2) effective\nradius $r_{\\rm e}>1.0''$, and (3) central surface brightness $\\mu_{\\rm 0}>24$\nmag arcsec$^{-2}$. Two of the three galaxies, COSMOS-UDG1 and COSMOS-UDG2, are\nrecognized as ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) with redshift $z=0.130$ and\n$0.049$, respectively. The third galaxy, COSMOS-dw1, is spectroscopically\nconfirmed as a dwarf galaxy at $z=0.004$. We derive the physical properties\nthrough fitting their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) extracted from deep\nmultiwavelength observations. COSMOS-dw1 has a stellar mass of\n$5.6_{-2.7}^{+2.5}\\times10^{6}$ M$_{\\odot}$, harboring neutral hydrogen gas of\nmass $4.90\\pm0.90\\times10^{6}$ M$_{\\odot}$, hinting that this galaxy may be in\nthe nascent stages of quenching. The estimated dynamical mass of\n$3.4\\times10^{7}\\,M_{\\odot}$ further suggests that COSMOS-dw1 is predominantly\nof dark matter. COSMOS-UDG1 and COSMOS-UDG2 exhibit comparable stellar masses\nof $\\sim 2\\times10^{8}$ M$_{\\odot}$. Notably, COSMOS-UDG1 is younger and more\nmetal-rich than COSMOS-UDG2 and COSMOS-dw1. Conversely, COSMOS-UDG2 and\nCOSMOS-dw1 have similar stellar metallicities, yet COSMOS-UDG2 is older than\nCOSMOS-dw1. All three galaxies adhere to the stellar mass-metallicity relation\n(MZR) for dwarf galaxies in the local Universe, implying they belong to the\ndwarf galaxy population.",

    "summary": "The Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) is a Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\ntreasury project.The COSMOS aims to perform a 2 square degree imaging survey of\nan equatorial field in $I$(F814W) band, using the Advanced Camera for Surveys\n(ACS). Such a wide field survey, combined with ground-based photometric and\nspectroscopic data, is essential to understand the interplay between large\nscale structure, evolution and formation of galaxies and dark matter. In 2004,\nwe have obtained high-quality, broad band images of the COSMOS field ($B, V,\nr^\\prime, i^\\prime,$ and $ z^\\prime$) using Suprime-Cam on the Subaru\nTelescope, and we have started our new optical multi-band program, COSMOS-21 in\n2005. Here, we present a brief summary of the current status of the COSMOS\nproject together with contributions from the Subaru Telescope. Our future\nSubaru program, COSMOS-21, is also discussed briefly.",
